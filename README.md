# Basic Ruby Projects

* To enter interactive ruby shell from local type:
```

Exit with CTRL + D
* To Determine class:
```ruby
"Hello".class
```
* To see built in methods for particular object
```ruby
"Hello".methods
```
* Variables you assign to another varialble (ex. var_1 = var_2) point to the initial value of the other variable, so you can change var_2 and the value of var_1 will stay as what var_2 was when you assigne it
